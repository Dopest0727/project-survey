# Survey form with React

This weeks project was to create a survey using React, a lot of fun and challenging.
Im specially proud of the styling, I really went all in.

## The problem

I went mobile first and read a LOT of the docs in order to understand it further. If i had more time i would look into making it more clean codewise.
As I am a begineer I dont quite know all the shortcuts.
